Hi, I'm Huyen :)

I'm transitioning into "Data Engineering for DeFi" with a strong background in data analysis and finance.

Technologies I'm learning and applying:
- Python (ETL, APIs)
- SQL (Dune Analytics)
- Data Engineering fundamentals
- DeFi data, market structure, TVL and protocol analytics

Featured Projects

1. ETH CEX Flows Warehouse

Combining on-chain exchange flow data (Dune), market price data (Binance), and network activity metrics (Etherscan) into clean daily tables, enabling exploratory analysis of ETH liquidity positioning, exchange flows, and market context.

3. Aave V3 Cross-Chain Lending

End-to-end pipeline using Dune SQL, Dune API, Python ETL, and Jupyter EDA to extract, clean, and analyze real on-chain liquidity data on Aave V3.

*Repository: [Aave V3 Cross-Chain Lending](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/aave_v3_cross_chain_lending)

*Dune Dashboard: [Cross Chain Lending Activity on Aave V3](https://dune.com/witin_paris/cross-chain-lending-activity-on-aave-v3)

4. Macro Market News Pipeline

Data pipeline for crypto, ETF, and macro market data using Yahoo Finance, Coinbase, with normalized storage in DuckDB and SQL-based data quality checks.

*Repository: [Pipeline: Macro Market News](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/macro_markets_news_pipeline)

---

5. GDELT Data Pipeline

Implementing a simple data pipeline using the GDELT dataset to ingest, clean, and analyze global news events for a given day. 

*Repository: [Pipeline: GDELT Data](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/gdelt_data_pipeline)

---

6. DeFi intelligence dashboards.

Build DeFi dashboards from raw on-chain data, featuring TVL, protocol, and category analysis using Python, ETL pipeline and Streamlit.

*Repository: [Witin - DeFi Intelligence](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/witin_defi_intelligence)

*Streamlit: [Witin - Where Data Becomes Conviction](https://witinnode.streamlit.app/)

> Note: The app may take ~10–20 seconds to wake up on first access due to Streamlit Cloud cold start.
