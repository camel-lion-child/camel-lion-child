Hi, I'm Huyen :)

I'm transitioning into "Data Engineering for DeFi" with a strong background in data analysis and finance.

Technologies I'm learning and applying:
- Python (ETL, APIs)
- SQL (Dune Analytics)
- Data Engineering fundamentals
- DeFi data, market structure, TVL and protocol analytics

Featured Projects

1. ETH CEX Flows Warehouse

Combines on-chain exchange flow data (Dune), market price data (Binance), and network activity metrics (Etherscan) into clean daily tables, enabling exploratory analysis of ETH liquidity positioning, exchange flows, and market context.

*Repository: [Warehouse: ETH Flows on CEXs](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/eth_cex_flows_warehouse)

*Dune Chart: [ETH Inflow & Outflow on CEXs](https://dune.com/queries/5971722/9632775)

2. DeFi Market Data Pipeline – ETL (Python)
   
Extracts DeFi TVL from DefiLlama and BTC/ETH price from Binance, transforms them into clean analysis-ready Parquet datasets, structured like a real Data Engineering project.

*Repository: [defi_market_data_pipeline](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/defi_market_data_pipeline)

3. Aave V3 Cross-Chain Lending

End-to-end pipeline using Dune SQL, Dune API, Python ETL, and Jupyter EDA to extract, clean, and analyze real on-chain liquidity data on Aave V3.

*Repository: [aave_v3_cross_chain_lending](https://github.com/camel-lion-child/aave_v3_cross_chain_lending)

*Dune Dashboard: [cross-chain-lending-activity-on-aave-v3](https://dune.com/witin_paris/cross-chain-lending-activity-on-aave-v3)
